# ducky-wordpress
A custom WordPress theme boilerplate using Gulp and Sass.

## Getting Started

After installing WordPress locally `cd` into its theme directory with:

    $ cd your-local-wordpress/wp-content/themes

You can now clone this repository into a new theme directory, setup a fresh instance of Git and install our Gulp dependencies (for Sass).

    $ git clone https://github.com/adamduckett/ducky-wordpress.git your-theme-folder
    $ cd your-theme-folder
    $ rm -rf .git/
    $ git init
    $ npm install
